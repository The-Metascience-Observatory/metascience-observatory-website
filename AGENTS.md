# AGENTS.md — Metascience Observatory Website

## Project Overview

The **Metascience Observatory** is a Next.js 15 full-stack application for exploring scientific replication data and running interactive "Bird's Eye Reviews" of research literatures. It is deployed on Vercel and lives at https://metascienceobservatory.org.

## Key Conventions

### Server vs. Client Components
- Pages default to **server components** for data loading
- Add `"use client"` only when interactivity or hooks are needed
- The pattern for large data pages (e.g. Long Covid): server `page.tsx` reads the file, processes into lean typed props, passes to a `"use client"` dashboard component — pass only the fields needed by the UI. Public download routes deliberately expose selected datasets; server-side loading does not make committed data private.

### Data Files
- The main replications database is a **CSV** loaded via the `/api/fred` API route (cached in module scope between requests)
- Bird's Eye Review data is **JSONL** read by the server component using `fs.readFileSync` at build/request time
- Always use `process.cwd()` + `path.join()` to build file paths in server code

### Styling
- **Tailwind utility-first** everywhere
- Color system uses **HSL CSS variables** (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, etc.) defined in `globals.css` — never hard-code colors, use Tailwind tokens
- Color overrides for charts use hex codes defined as constants at the top of the component file
- Dark mode: class-based (`.dark`) via next-themes, CSS vars have dark variants
- Responsive: `md:` breakpoints throughout; mobile-first

### Component Patterns
- UI primitives in `components/ui/` follow shadcn/ui conventions (CVA variants, Radix primitives)
- Chart sections use a shared `ChartSection` wrapper with title/subtitle
- RoB (Risk of Bias) colors: `low=#22c55e`, `some_concerns=#f59e0b`, `high=#ef4444`
- Intervention category colors are defined in `CATEGORY_COLORS` / `INTERVENTION_PALETTE`

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled (`tsconfig.json`)
- Data shape interfaces live alongside the component/page that uses them (e.g. `types.ts` next to the dashboard)
- Avoid `any`; use `eslint-disable` comments only when truly unavoidable

### Routing
- Pages use the Next.js App Router file convention
- Backward-compatibility redirects are defined in `next.config.mjs`
- The `@/` alias maps to the project root

## Data: Replications Database

- **File:** `data/replications_database_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS.csv` (update the filename when a new version is added)
- **`data/` holds exactly ONE of these.** Every superseded version is moved to `data/backup/`. `data_ingestor.py` does this automatically via `archive_superseded_masters()`; if you write a new master by hand, archive the old one yourself.
- Nothing globs for the master — `app/api/fred/route.ts` and the `scripts/build_*.py` helpers all read the **last non-comment line of `data/version_history.txt`**, so that line must always name a file that exists in `data/`.
- **One row per replicated effect**, not per study or per paper; row counts change with each release
- Key columns: `original_title`, `original_url` (full DOI resolver URL), `replication_url`, `replication_initiative_tag`, `original_es_r`, `replication_es_r`, `replication_es_95_CI` (string `[low, high]`), `original_es_type`, `replication_es_type`, `discipline`, `result`
- DOIs stored as full resolver URLs: `https://doi.org/10.xxxx/...`
- Effect size CIs stored as strings: `[lower, upper]` — parse with JSON.parse after stripping
- `replication_initiative_tag` groups rows by project (e.g. `XPHIR`, `RP:P`, `ML1`)
- `initiative_tag_names.json` maps tags to human-readable project names
- `upstream_effect_id` (e.g. `fred:1981`) is the row's stable id in its source database — use it to re-match on refresh instead of matching on description text
- Full column reference: `data/data_dictionary.csv`

### Duplicate detection — read before writing any dedup check

A shared `(original_url, replication_url)` pair is **not** evidence of duplication. ~900 pairs legitimately hold many rows:

- **Multi-lab initiatives** (`ML1`–`ML5`, `RRR`, `SPRRR`, `SRP`, `RP:CB`) store one row per lab or per assay — verbal overshadowing is 56 rows, ego depletion 24. Exclude these tags from every dedup key.
- **`description` is not a per-effect field.** FReD and Curate Science rows carry the *paper's* claim, so sibling rows describing different outcomes look identical. Never key on it alone.
- Blank `result` is deliberate: the FReD ingest maps `OS not significant` and `Not calculable` to `""`.

A duplicate needs matching **effect sizes and sample sizes on both sides**, after normalizing DOIs — lowercase, strip the resolver prefix, and **collapse repeated slashes** (legacy APA DOIs are registered as `10.1037//0022-3514...`; leaving them distinct is what let duplicates through in July 2026).

## Data: Long Covid JSONL

- **Bundle:** `data/birds_eye_reviews/long_covid/`; primary extraction file: `trial_extractions.jsonl`. See `last_updated.json` for release metadata.
- `lib/long-covid/data-path.ts` resolves the bundle path; `LONG_COVID_DATA_DIR` is an optional server-only override for local release validation.
- Publication filtering and public article serialization live in `lib/long-covid/`.
- One JSON object per line
- Each record: `paper_id` (DOI), `study_design` (arms, countries, blinding, design_type), `sample_sizes`, `outcomes` (is_primary, symptom_domain, between_group_effects with effect_value/ci/p_value, higher_is_better), `risk_of_bias` (overall_judgment + RoB2 domains), `participants` (long_covid_definition, min_time_since_infection_weeks), `follow_up`
- Server-side processing in `page.tsx` converts this into ~10 typed data structures for the dashboard

## API Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/fred` | Loads main replications CSV, caches in memory, serves as JSON |
| `/api/retraction-watch` | Loads retraction watch data; provides aggregations |
| `/api/subscribe` | Mailchimp newsletter subscription |
| `/api/upload-bibliography` | Match uploaded bibliography DOIs against the database |
| `/api/screening` | Filtered Long Covid screening records |
| `/api/screening/download` | Public screening CSV download |
| `/api/long-covid/article` | Published article details |

---

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev     # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run build   # Production build (validates types + checks for errors)
npm run check:tools # Validate the tool catalog
npm run test:publications # Publication-filter regression tests
# npm run lint currently requires ESLint setup; see README.md.
```

Always run `npm run build` before pushing to verify there are no TypeScript or compilation errors. Vercel builds on push to `main`.

## Vercel Deployment Notes

- Deployed on **Vercel Hobby plan** — commits must have a GitHub-linked email as the author
- Use `git config user.email` matching your GitHub account email to avoid blocked deployments
- The `outputFileTracingRoot` in `next.config.mjs` is set to the project root (`process.cwd()`); `data/backup/` is excluded from tracing

---

## Sanity CMS

Sanity CMS is **not used**. The `next-sanity` dependency, `sanity.config.ts`, and `check-sanity-setup.js` have all been removed. Ignore any Sanity references.
